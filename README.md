Get Educated is a site designed for people interested in a certain subject to have a "one-stop shop."
The user can search the topic, and see the latest articles relating to it, as well as a list of non-profit organizations in which they can contribute, both of these lists will be provided by different APIs. In addition to recieving information, the user can contribute personal notes which be saved locally with Firebase.

The site was designed simply with Bootstrap, we used ProPublica's Non-Profit API (https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/api) as well as the News API (https://newsapi.org/)
